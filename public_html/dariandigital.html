				<h2>Video Services</h2>
				
				<p class="services">Our Video Packages Includes Two Camera Coverage with Editing in "REAL" Time.</p>

The music or what you are saying is interrupted. We use two cameras to switch back and forth to produce your complete <strong><em>Wedding Ceremony</em></strong>, start to finish! Professional quality audio systems are used to hear every word and all the moments of your wedding PERECTLY! You receive three DVD copies for you and your family in "Movie Style" video cases with your photos on it, just like Hollywood movies you buy!<p>

			<h2>Who we are.</h2>
			
			<p class="about-text">
				<table align="right">
				<tr><td><img src="images/about.jpg" align="right"/></td></tr>
				<tr><td><p class="caption">Our first studio, opened March 23, 1973. The name was shortened in 1985 to "Darien Professional Photo" and again changed as the photography industry moved to digital to "Darien Digital Photo & Video"</p></td></tr>
			</table>Our company has been dedicated to producing the finest wedding images at an affordable fee. It is our belief that every “bride to be” dreams of having beautiful wedding day and cherishes the memories whether she has a big budget or a modest one. Technology has changed the photography industry in many ways over the last decade. The Internet and digital photography has changed the way we now do business. The brick and mortar studio of the past has evolved to the new cyber business of today. Now almost everyone buys on line from companies like amazon.com, pays bills with on line banking and watches movies over the Internet or cable.</p>


			<p class="about-text">To reduce costs, our company has made some of the same changes. Most of our business nationally is done on line. We produce our product totally through high tech digital systems to give you quality and value. We have a very limited product so we can focus on keeping production costs down and provide the most value for your investment. We offer one package that can be adapted to your desires and save you a great deal of money. With today’s economy, many brides sadly make the mistake of having a friend take her wedding images only to be very disappointed after it is too late. Once the wedding is over, you will never be able to recreate that special moment two became one and a new family begins. The fun and the party will never be relived again except through your cherished wedding photography that only a trained professional can produce.</p>


			<p class="about-text">In addition to our high tech operational systems, our photographers are specially trained to produce images that you want and will cherish. Every photographer attends our own school to bring their skills to the high expectations we demand. Not only are they trained in photographic techniques, but we also place a very high value on the social aspect of working with a bride at her wedding. Every photographer must meet our professional and social standards before we allow them to photograph a wedding as a <em>Darien Digital Photographer.</em></p>


			<p class="about-text">Our customer service staff is available to help you plan your perfect wedding album. Our corporate headquarters is located in Las Vegas Nevada. Our photographers nationally are available locally as we do attend local bridal shows every where we offer our services. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. We all take pride in our superior service and to produce wedding memories that exceed your every expectation.</p>
